        <title>New Website</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-website-launch&quot;&gt;New Website Launch&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 weeks ago we set up on the adventure of a lifetime: to launch the first digital bank in Africa. We wanted to make sure we would build a product and service that people would love. A product that would be unique and a product that you will continuously tell all your friends and family about. 
# The landing page #
It’s natural, before you build a business you need to talk to customers to see if they really need your product or service. Most people call this the Mom Test. What is the Mom Test?
“The Mom Test is a quick, practical guide that will save you time, money, and heartbreak. They say you shouldn’t ask your mom whether your business is a good idea, because she loves you and will lie to you”. 
So to get really good feedback from people, we had to talk to them and let them know, in the simplest way possible, what Zazu will be doing. And the feedback was amazing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;53% wanted a new bank. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;14% had no bank at all. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those that wanted a new bank, were fed up with really bad experiences from their current banks. From long queues, to unexplained charges and sub-par customer service. They simply wanted a new and better experience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ones that didn’t have a bank account, explained their hopes and ideals. Some of them didn’t know what banks did. So we wrote a blog ‘What do Banks really do?’’ and from that, a sizable number of you got in touch asking us to write or teach people about financial literacy. In particular, how do people save money? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This question was particularly popular from people living or working in the Copperbelt. Of everyone who got in touch with us asking about financial literacy, the majority were in the Copperbelt, so we decided to actually do something about this. In September, we will be teaching 2 000 people about saving, lending, borrowing and how to run a business from an accounting point of view. Initially we wanted to host real life sessions but we realised we couldn’t possibly do that. So we decided to do it via your mobile phone. Watch this space. 
# Designing Our Website #
As we spoke to more and more people, we were asking about their financial habits. And it came out that everyone was concerned about their future. They wanted to understand exactly how much money they had at that moment. When they spent something, they wanted instant feedback so they can never be overdrawn. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We sat down and looked at our website and asked ourselves, does this communicate what we want to do? And it was a strong no. 
So our current website is our attempt to share more about our vision, product and the first steps to create a community. We would absolutely love it if you would tell us your thoughts and feelings about the new website. &lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What Do Banks Really Do?</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-do-banks-really-do&quot;&gt;What Do Banks Really Do?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks are not that different from any other business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What sets them apart is that they work with money: looking after it, lending it, and helping you pay for things with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;looking-after-your-money&quot;&gt;Looking after your money&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cash is very dangerous to walk around with. It’s fine to walk with small amounts of cash but if you carry huge amounts of cash, its very dangerous and criminals might rob you. So the safest place to put the money in, is a bank. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really good banks around the world, do not charge you to use your account e.g. safe-keep your money. So when you make a deposit into the bank, you are telling the bank to hold the money safe until you need it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;lending-money&quot;&gt;Lending Money&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because banks have many people telling them to hold their money, they can lend it to other people who need the money. A person might want a loan to get a roof for their house, buy a business or get married etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So banks lend money to these people and these people spend the money on the economy, which makes the economy grow. Banks lend this money and get paid interest, which is just another way of saying they make a profit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the bank is lending your money to someone else, the big bank in your country, which is the regulator, and in Zambia, is the Bank of Zambia, makes sure that all banks have sufficient financial resources (money) in case they lend to bad people who can’t afford to repay. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;payments&quot;&gt;Payments&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the future, people will rely less and less on cash. This is because paying for things in cash, is expensive and keeps poor people, poor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks around the world have to abide by global trends and help people to adapt to new environment. So they provide debit and credit cards to help you pay for things in shops or online. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you use a card to buy, say, food, the money is transferred from your bank account to the bank account of the shop. Exactly the same thing happens when you pay for things using your debit or credit card online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If these payments stopped working, then the entire economy would grind to a halt.  This is why the Bank of Zambia oversees these payments, to make sure they operate smoothly every day.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Welcome to Zazu</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Zazu?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zazu wants to be Africa’s first digital-only bank. It is extremely expensive to open and operate bank branches, especially in developing countries. As a result, people do not have bank accounts. And they don’t interact with financial services at all. We want to change this. We want to provide a service that other banks cannot offer: a bank that is easy to approach, a bank that tells you exactly what you are spending &amp;amp; a bank that takes away all the unnecessary fees. We want to build a bank that helps you manage your money better, so that you can achieve your objectives, from building a house to a weekend escape. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extremely bad service is very very common among African banks. From the scary security guards outside, to the grumpy overworked bank teller. Most banks seem to be relics of colonialism in which the customer is made to feel uncomfortable. Despite giving them your money. There is no reason why in today’s age we should still feel down when heading to the bank knowing the queue we’ll be facing. Nor should we get demoralised by the amount of paperwork to fill in to simply open an account. Not to talk about the money disappearing from our accounts when we use the ATM. Zazu wants to answer all of these questions and more.  We are building a bank to change all of this. A bank which answers to you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;here-is-the-roadmap&quot;&gt;Here is the roadmap.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September 2017 we will launch with 1500 pre paid debit cards. We want to give these out to people who regularly use cards to make payments, because we want to understand how to develop our app to be the best it can. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November 2017 we will release Zazu Pay. Which will allow merchants across the country to accept digital payments. Easily. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In January 2018, we hope to have received the Banking Licence from the Bank of Zambia and we hope to launch our digital bank only. &lt;/p&gt;
